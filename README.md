# ranked_pairs_PUT_reinforcement
Applying reinforcement learning to learn efficient heuristics for the PUT (parallel universes tiebreaking) problem for Tideman's ranked pairs social choice algorithm.

Ranked pairs PUT algorithm based off "Practical Algorithms for STV and Ranked Pairs with Parallel Universes Tiebreaking" by Jun Wang, Sujoy Sikdar, Tyler Shepherd, Zhibing Zhao, Chunheng Jiang and Lirong Xia from AAAI-19.

main.py runs the code, params.py has configurable parameters.

rpconfig.py defines paths to relevant needed data files.
